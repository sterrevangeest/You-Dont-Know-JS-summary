# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
## Chapter 1: Types

Meaning of **types** in JS: a type is an intrinsic, built-in set of characteristics that uniquely identifies the behavior of a particular value and distinguishes it from other values, both to the engine and to the developer.

JS built-in types: 
`Undefined`, `Null`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`, `Object` and `Symbol` (added in ES6)
All of these types are called "primitves", except `object`.
